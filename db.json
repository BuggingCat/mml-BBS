First run the **backend**\n\n   ```shell\n   cd BBSmarkdown\n   node server.js\n   ```\n\n2. Then in **frontend**\n\n   ```shell\n   cd public\n   anywhere\n   ```\n\n3. Now you can enter the **https** website where frontend is running. If you want to share your **location** when you post, be sure to allow the browser to get your location.",
